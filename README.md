## Credit Score Classification Project_with_MLflow

This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to classify credit scores. Credit scores play a crucial role in determining an individual's creditworthiness, influencing loan approvals, interest rates, and financial opportunities. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to predict credit scores accurately based on relevant features such as financial history, demographics, and credit utilization.

### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop robust classification models that accurately predict credit scores. These models will assist financial institutions and lenders in assessing the creditworthiness of individuals, thereby enabling better decision-making processes.

### Dataset:
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing relevant attributes such as income, debt-to-income ratio, credit history, and other demographic information. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

### Techniques:
Machine learning algorithms and techniques are explored in this project are:
- Random Forest Classifier

### Evaluation:
The performance of the model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are employed to enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the models.
